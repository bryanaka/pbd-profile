** Description: grid.css contains all the files necessary for making a responsive, fluid grid 
**	that uses inline-block elements instead of floats. This allows for control over 
**	vertical alignment and finer control of css in general. If you do not need responsive, 
**	remove the last media query.
**
** Credit: I want to thank Daniel Edan for Toast. He wrote most of this code, I just 
**	altered it for my own needs. http://daneden.me/
**	Twitter Bootstrap for the responsive utilities - https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/
**
** TO-DO
** =================================
** Make variables and framework set up easy to use.
** Reduce CSS with some silent classes. Make Silent Classes an easy addition.

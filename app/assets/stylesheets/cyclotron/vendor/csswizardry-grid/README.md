**Simple, fluid, nestable, flexible, Sass-based, responsive grid system.**

* Fully responsive
* Infinitely nestable
* Endless possible combinations
* Simple to understand, human-friendly classes
* Option to keep classes out of your HTML
* Robust
* Simple
* No `.clear` or `.last` classes
* It just _works_

Please see [Responsive grid systems; a solution?](http://csswizardry.com/2013/02/responsive-grid-systems-a-solution/)
for a comprehensive overview of the principles of the grid system.

## Setup

Simply fill in/adjust the relevant variables.

* `$gutter` controls how much space there is between columns.
* `$use-silent-classes` tells csswizardry-grids whether to go ahead and compile
  solid, traditional classes (e.g. `.one-whole`) or to create Sass ‘silent’
  classes which only compile to CSS once explictly called.
* `$lap-start` and `$desk-start` tell csswizardry-grids when to fire particular
  media queries to service those particular sizes. Note that csswizardry-grids
  works out the ends of any other breakpoints by using these numbers.

## Basic usage

If you are using traditional classes then an example, basic usage might look
like this:

    <div class="grid">
    
        <div class="grid__item  one-whole  lap-one-half  desk-two-thirds">
            ...
        </div>
    
        <div class="grid__item  one-whole  lap-one-half  desk-one-third">
            ...
        </div>
    
    </div>

If you are using silent classes then your HTML might look like this:

    <div class="page">
    
        <div class="content">
            ...
        </div>
    
        <div class="sub-content">
            ...
        </div>
    
    </div>

…and your Sass, something like this:

    .page{
        @extend %grid;
    }
    
        .content,
        .sub-content{
            @extend %grid__item;
            @extend %one-whole;
            @extend %lap-one-half;
        }
    
        .content{
            @extend %desk-two-thirds;
        }
    
        .sub-content{
            @extend %desk-one-third;
        }

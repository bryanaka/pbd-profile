Scientist Profile Editor
=============================

The Scientist profile editor was created to make it as easy as possible for scientists to edit their personal pages. The editor is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, or an inline editor. This means that you change the page itself by clicking on the sections you want to edit, making changes, and then saving those changes. Your web page will be near identical to what is published on our website (save a few helping elements for the editor side). 

At first there may be minor inconsistencies, but our goal is to give our scientists the easiest editing experience possible. Should you notice any major inconsistencies, please don't hesitate to report the bugs, and we will get on it right away.

Editing your Name: _Warning_
----------------------------------
Editing your name may break links made to your webpage, since the shortcut URL is generated by the first letter of the first name and the last name. 

To ensure that links break as little as possible, you are given a permalink, which will not change and should stay active as long as you are part of the laboratory. This URL will use a trailing scientist ID number like `pbd.lbl.gov/people/5` instead of `pbd.lbl.gov/people/tabler`

Scientist Profile Editor
=============================

The Scientist profile editor is made to be as easy as possible for scientsts to edit their pages. The editor is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. You edit your profile inline, changing the page itself, and once you save the changes, your web page will be near identical to what is published on our website (save a few helping elements for the editor side). 

At first, there may be minor inconsistancies, but our hope is to give you, the scientist, the easiest editing ability possible. Should you notice any major inconsistancies, please dont hesitate to report the bugs and we will get on it right away.

Editing your Name: _Warning_
----------------------------------
Editing your name may break links made to your webpage, since the shortcut url is generated the first letter of the first name and the last name. To ensure that links break as little as possible, you are given a permalink, which should stay active as long as you are part of the laboratory.

This url will look closer to `pbd.lbl.gov/people/5` instead of `pbd.lbl.gov/people/tabler`
